# General

This repository includes the settings that I use for my Sublime Text 3 editor. It includes snippets, macros, key-bindings, etc. You can fork this repository and change it or you can just pick things that you find useful and use them wherever you want.

Beside this sublime mini-package, I will describe below the coding style that I use. Just as the snippets, you can check it out and use what you feel useful.
